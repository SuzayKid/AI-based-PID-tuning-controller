## **Project 1: Automated PID Controller Tuning Using Genetic Algorithms in Hardware-in-the-Loop Systems**

**Abstract**  
Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controllers are the standard for industrial motor positioning and speed control, yet they are tedious to tune due to  inefficiencies of manual tuning methods like Ziegler-Nichols. These traditional approaches frequently fail due to factors such as human tuning error,  friction and sensor noise, leading to suboptimal control. To address this, this project implements a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) system that utilises a Python-based genetic algorithm to autonomously optimise control parameters for an L298N \- based motor driver. The design treats tuning as a multi-objective optimisation problem, iteratively testing parameter sets on physical hardware without requiring a complex mathematical model of the plant. Experimental results measure overshoot, settling time, and steady-state error, allowing the system to learn and adapt to the specific motor characteristics in real-time. The final analysis demonstrates that evolutionary algorithms can achieve rapid convergence to stable operating points, providing a robust solution for adaptive embedded control applications.
