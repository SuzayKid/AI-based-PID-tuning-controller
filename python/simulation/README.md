# Simulation Module

This directory will contain a **pure-software simulation** of the motor system. It allows testing the Genetic Algorithm without needing hardware connected.

## Future Files
- `simulated_motor.py` — A physics-based model of the DC motor + potentiometer.
- `sim_runner.py` — Runs the GA against the simulated motor.

## Purpose
- Rapid prototyping and debugging of the AI without hardware risk.
- Useful for tweaking Cost Function weights before running on real hardware.
